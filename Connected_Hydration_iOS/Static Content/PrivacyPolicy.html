                    <h3 style="color:black;">Privacy Policy of Epicore Biosystems</h3>
</br>
<p>Epicore Biosystems, Inc. (“Epicore Biosystems,” “we,” “us,” “our”) respects your privacy and strives to offer you a safe customer experience. With this Privacy Policy we want to tell you about what data we collect when you use our products and services, and how we use and handle this data. We’ll also tell you where to find out more about how your personal information is handled and what rights you have with respect to this information.</p>
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Using Epicore Biosystems Services in Short</h3>
<p>
When you use Epicore Biosystems websites (including epicorebiosystems.com), products, services, and mobile apps (collectively, the “Services”) we may collect your personal information. That information is used only to offer you the Service in question, nothing else. <b>Epicore Biosystems does not sell your personal information.</b> We may be providing this Service as part of a service with your employer’s (or partnering enterprise) health and services team members. In such a case, they would never see your personal data but only anonymized group statistics to help them improve safety. <b>We will ask you to consent if you wish to share anonymized, statistical data with your employer or partnering enterprise.</b>  We may use some of the data in research and development work to improve our services, but for such purposes data is cleared from identifiers to the maximum amount possible.
</br>
</br>
Data Access by party:
</br>
You – own and have access to all of your sensor data and personal information.
Epicore Biosystems – access to your sensor data and personal information to provide computations and the Services.
Partnering Enterprise/Employer – access to anonymous group statistics such as number of alarms during the week. No access to your personal information. No access to your individual sensor data.
</br>
</br>
BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW EPICORE BIOSYSTEMS TO COLLECT AND PROCESS INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION. IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO PROVIDE SUCH INFORMATION, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO USE OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MANY OF OUR SERVICES.
</p>
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">How We Handle Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>
</br>
When you create a user account for certain Epicore Biosystems Services, we ask for some personal information (for example your name, email address, biological sex at birth, and age). We need this information in order to provide you with a personalized experience with our Services. For example, we use your height, weight and biological sex at birth information to compute your whole body sweat loss which determines your rehydration recommendation. If you give us false information about your height, weight, and biological sex at birth, our algorithms will not calculate correct results for you, and we therefore trust that all the information you provide are accurate.
</br>
</br>
Our sensors collect sweat loss volume and sweat electrolyte loss, temperature, and motion to generate a hydration recommendation. When you use your phone to log data, GPS coordinates are collected. This happens only if you give consent specifically for geolocation and when you use the Epicore Biosystems app to actively log information to allow for analysis of pertinent weather information and heat wave warnings. 
</br>
</br>
If you subscribe to Epicore Biosystems’ newsletter, we will collect your email address. We only process your personal information for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy and for the service-specific purposes on which you can find more information by clicking on the links provided. You can also contact our privacy@epicorebiosystems.com for more information on the handling of personal information with regard to each Service.
</br>
</br>
In addition to the uses of personal information identified above, we may use your personal information to ensure the proper function and safety of Epicore Biosystems products, to verify your identity, to provide user support, to investigate fraud and other misuse of the products, and for legal purposes. We may also process your information as part of our research and product development activities – we are continuously developing new functionalities and improving on existing ones.
</br>
</br>
We will not rent or sell customer lists that include your personal information. We will not share your personal information except for the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your personal information (i) for the reasons we tell you when we collect it, or (ii) in the following ways:
<ul style="color:black">
<li><u>With Your Consent.</u> We may share personal information when we have your consent. 
</li>
<li><u>For External Processing.</u> We may engage contractors, service providers, and third-party technicians (collectively, the “Subcontractors”) to assist with some of the data processing, storage and use described in this Privacy Policy, including to help answer your questions. Our Subcontractors may include marketing, operations, and technology vendors. These Subcontractors may also assist with monitoring our servers (including third-party servers used by Epicore Biosystems) for technical problems. These Subcontractors (as well as Epicore Biosystems’ employees) may be given access to certain personal information about you or your account if necessary to provide those services.  In no event will these Subcontractors be allowed to use this data for purposes not permitted under this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li><u>As Part of Business Transitions.</u> If Epicore Biosystems participates in the sale or transfer of Epicore Biosystems business and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred. We will require that any purchaser treat our data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li><u>For Legal Reasons.</u> We will share personal information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is required by Epicore Biosystems to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request; (ii) enforce Epicore Biosystems’ policies  or contracts, including in connection with the investigation of potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) lawfully protect the rights, property or safety of Epicore Biosystems, our customers and users of the Services or the public.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<u>Aggregate Information.</u> We may share non-personal information (for example, aggregated or anonymized customer data) publicly and with our partners. We will take steps to ensure that this non-personal information does not identify you, and we require any of our partners who have access to that non-personal information to do the same. We may also use information collected from you or the Services in a non-personally identifiable or aggregate form to help us improve the Services, make sales, marketing, and business decisions. This information is not personal information because it does not identify you or any particular individual or disclose your or any particular individual’s data.
</p>
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Security</h3>
<p>
</br>
There are always risks associated with providing personal information, whether in person, by phone or via the internet or other technologies, and no system or technology is completely safe or "tamper"/"hacker" proof. We use industry-standard methods and procedures to keep your personal information safe and secure when it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to Epicore Biosystems’ servers, including any third-party servers utilized by Epicore Biosystems, where your information is processed.
</br>
</p>
<h3 style="color:black;">Where do we process your information? </h3>
</br>
<p>
All information collected by the Services will be processed in and subject to the laws of the United States of America.  If you are not located in the United States of America, such laws may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as those in your home country. By using the Services and providing us your personal information, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to, and processing of your personal information in, the United States of America.
</p>
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Your Rights</h3>
</br>
<p>

<b>You always have the right to access your personal information.</b> In most of the Services, direct access is possible, and when necessary, email privacy@epicorebiosystems.com, and we can assist you and deliver a copy of the personal information we have of you. You have the right to know what information pertaining to you has been collected, what this information is used for, and the parties, if any, that it has been disclosed to. To verify your identity in order to carry out your request, we may have to ask for additional information.
 </br>
</br>
Epicore Biosystems is allowed to handle your personal information when the handling is based on a legitimate interest. We use this legal basis in some cases for our research and development activities as we constantly want to develop and improve our services. This type of processing of data is vital for Epicore Biosystems to develop and offer you better features and up-to-date technical know-how. You can choose not to share certain information with Epicore Biosystems. However, if you choose not to share such information, you might not be able to use or take advantage of many of our Services.
</br>
</br>
<b>You always have the right to prohibit direct marketing. </b> If you have given your consent to receive marketing messages from Epicore Biosystems, you can stop receiving them by following the "unsubscribe" instructions within each email communication. If you have created a user account, you can do this directly via our service. Epicore Biosystems will not provide or share any mailing lists to third parties for promotional purposes. Emails related to services (to confirm a purchase, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the service you requested. Such emails also include notifications about changes to our Privacy Policy.
</br>
</br>
<b>You have the right to have any of your personal information deleted</b> by sending a request to our privacy team at privacy@epicorebiosystems.com. If you want to have your personal information deleted, we will delete your user credentials and all personal information and personal data. This includes personal data in all Epicore Biosystems Services that you have used. The deleted data is not retrievable. After we’ve deleted your information, you can only use the service by creating a new user account. 
</br>
</br>
In some of our Services we request your consent. We request consent only in cases when it is necessary for offering the Service. <b>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</b> The consent can be withdrawn within the Service. Note that for some Services, if you choose not to provide your consent, you might not be able to use or take advantage of some of our Services.
</p>
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Using User Data for Research and Development</h3>
</br>
<p>
Epicore Biosystems focuses on personalized hydration and metabolic health management solutions. We have in-house experts specializing in material science, microfluidics, bioelectronics, chemistry, physiology, sports training, health and data science, and we carry out studies pertaining to wearable technologies, sports training, heat illness and nutrition on a regular basis.
</br>
</br>
<b>Types of Research</b>
</br>
</br>
Epicore Biosystems continuously studies human physiology and hydration to develop new technologies, products and services but also improve on existing ones. New algorithms are being developed and tested, and customer mass data is used to, for example, find anomalies in the features or to find devices that may not be working properly. These results are not shared outside of the company. They only support the in-house development work.
</br>
</br>
Some of the research is performed in cooperation with third-party research partners. The aim of research collaboration is to produce a scientific publication of the results. In these instances, the research work is conducted according to research study protocols and ethical requirements imposed on the study. In these studies, no customer data is given to the third-party research partners, but instead all data is processed within Epicore Biosystems and by our research team. If any customer personal data is used in the research, customers are asked to review a separate informed consent to use their personal data for the specific research project.
</br>
</br>
Marketing research aims to better understand users of Epicore Biosystems’ devices and services, inform how the devices are being used in the field, and gauge what new features customers may want in future products. Marketing research is performed by analyzing data from users who have given their consent for marketing purposes. 
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Error Logs and Log Data</h3>
</br>
<p>
To offer the best possible service in the event of a problem, we store error data on our devices (“Error log”). When you synchronize your device with Epicore Biosystems’ service, the Error log is copied onto our server and saved there for a period of two years at maximum.
The Error log is only used for error analysis and statistical purposes on the basis of our legitimate interest. It can be used, for example, when you contact our customer service about an error or when you report a bug in your device software. 
</br>
</br>
When you visit our websites, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser.

<h3 style="color:black;">Connected Hydration Worker Safety Cloud and App</h3>
</br>
<p>
Epicore Biosystems’ Connected Hydration Worker Safety Cloud (the “Cloud”) is the associated cloud-based worker safety service that helps workers proactively hydrate and effectively recover during their work shift. The Cloud is connected to a weather reporting service to provide workers with real-time alerts. The Cloud also analyzes sweat loss, water and electrolyte intake, and temperature to provide recommendations and information to keep you physically and cognitively safe. Information is conveyed to you via the mobile app. 
</br>
</br>
Before you can start using the Cloud, you must create a user account. You have the option to use your Connected Hydration device in a stand-alone mode with limited functionality (such as receiving real-time hydration recommendations); however, any historical data, trend analysis, proactive hydration recommendations based on weather would not be enabled. We will ask you for your consent to share anonymized data collected from you with your employer or partnering enterprise. By providing your consent, you grant Epicore Biosystems permission to handle your data exclusively for the specified purposes and nothing else. If you do consent, your anonymized data will be aggregated into anonymized group statistics, such as the number of bottles of water workers drink a given week, or the number of dehydration alarms of all workers triggered during a given month, which Epicore Biosystems may share with your employer or partner enterprise. Epicore Biosystems does not share personal information (email, height, weight, biological sex at birth, and age) or identifiable individual sensor data with your employer or enterprise partners.  
</br>
<h3 style="color:black;">Discovery Patch®

</br>
<p>The Discovery Patch® Sweat Collection System is designed to collect sweat during on-body wear for biomarker research. The Discovery Patch® is intended for use by researchers and healthcare professionals for the collection of sweat in home and professional healthcare settings for biomarker research. Guidance for data privacy is governed by study protocols and informed consent.</p>
